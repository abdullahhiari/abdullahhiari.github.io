            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the visionary initiative of the Al Hussen Technical University (HTU) Engineering Design course!
                Company XYZ is a simulated endeavor born out of the collaborative efforts of our enthusiastic team at HTU.
                In this course, our goal is to embark on the journey of creating a product from scratch, establishing a
                company, and ultimately bringing our creation to market.</p>
    
            <p>As students passionate about engineering and design, we are immersed in the dynamic and challenging world
                of product development. Company XYZ serves as the vessel through which we apply our theoretical knowledge
                to real-world scenarios, gaining invaluable hands-on experience in the process.</p>
    
            <p>Driven by innovation and guided by our instructors, our mission is to conceptualize, design, and produce a
                product that not only meets industry standards but also addresses a specific need in the market. Through
                this simulation, we aim to cultivate skills in teamwork, project management, and the practical aspects of
                bringing a product to fruition.</p>
    
            <p>Join us on this exciting journey as we navigate the intricacies of engineering design, entrepreneurship,
                and business development. Together, let's turn ideas into reality and lay the foundation for a successful
                company in the realm of technology and innovation.</p>

            <h2>XT Cart</h2>
            <p>The project aims to develop a cost-effective and portable device tailored for Jordanian households, addressing the specific need to transfer, lift, and position heavy objects like refillable 20-liter water bottles and reusable gas tanks. The device must adhere to a set of essential features and constraints, including compatibility with locally prevalent water bottles and gas tanks, maximum durability, lightweight design, minimal storage space requirements, low maintenance costs, user-friendly operation, safety, and manufacturability within the existing XT-Tools capabilities. The primary goal is to create a practical solution that is not only efficient in handling heavy items commonly found in Jordanian homes but is also affordable, user-friendly, and meets stringent durability and safety standards.</p>
    
            <p>The project involves designing a versatile cart with the capability to carry both water bottles and gas tanks. The cart is equipped with a lifting mechanism that allows it to elevate these items to a height of approximately 1 meter. </p>
    
            <p>After reaching the desired height, the cart possesses a flipping mechanism, enabling it to invert its load. This functionality serves a crucial purpose in distinguishing between water bottles and gas tanks. Once inverted, a sensor system is employed to identify the contents of the load. </p>
    
            <p>If the sensor detects a water bottle, the cart intelligently places it on a designated cooler. This innovative solution streamlines the process of transporting and sorting water bottles and gas tanks efficiently, demonstrating a practical and automated approach to handling different items in a specific environment.</p>
